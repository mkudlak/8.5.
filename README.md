Task: Conditional instructions in practice
Create the variables needed to perform the action (a * a) - (2 * a * b) + (b * b), and assign the result to the variable value. Display the result in the console, then use a conditional statement to check whether the result is positive or negative, and then display the result of a positive or negative result in the console.
